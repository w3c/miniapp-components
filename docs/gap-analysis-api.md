# MiniApp APIs Gap Analysis 

## Scope of the analysis

As we [proposed at TPAC 2024](https://www.w3.org/2024/09/26-miniapp-minutes.html#x388), we have analyzed and collected insights about the requirements for the essential structural [MiniApp elements](./gap-analysis-elements) (i.e., the HTML-like elements used in the MiniApp components) and the API and services associated to different MiniApp platforms (this document). 

The main objective of the analysis is to collect insights on the common requirements for MiniApps, and to understand the feasibility of reusing the wide-spread standard Web standards (i.e., DOM and Web APIs) to solve the needs of these MiniApps.

For the analysis, we have grouped the similar elements of four reference MiniApp platforms - [QuickApps](https://www.quickapp.cn/), [Alipay Mini Programs](https://docs.alipay.com/mini/developer/), [Baidu Smart Mini Programs](https://smartprogram.baidu.com/developer/index.html), and [WeChat Mini Programs](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/framework/)) - and the equivalent [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API) to implement the same capabilities.

EDITOR NOTE: The study is __still in progress__ (please file a issue to fix anything that is wrong), and it might have missed important details. It was totally based on public developer information (most of the documentation is in Chinese).


### Summary of common MiniApps APIs and standard equivalent
